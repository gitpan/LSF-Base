This is the first version of this library. Most of the functions in the 
API have been implemented, but only a few have been tested, as you can
see from the test.pl. The Testlist file shows which calls have been tested
as of today.

If you are interested in contributing at this point, you can:

1: Write some more tests so I can get this whole thing tested.
2: Flesh out the interfaces to a few calls that I haven't implemented
   yet, ls_loadinfo() being the most notable.
3: If you have ideas for improving the "perlishness" of the interface
   chime right in.
4: start working on LSF::Batch, although I'd appreciate if we agreed
   on an approach so that the API would remain consistent.

Notes:

I've only tested this on an IBM AIX 4.3.2 machine running perl 5.00403.
It should be easily portable.

You'll need to edit the Makefile.PL so it can find your version of the
LSF includes and libraries.
